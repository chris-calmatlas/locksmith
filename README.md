[A simple locksmith website](https://locksmith.calmatlas.com/)

## Simple html website built by Chris J
This is a simple example of a static website built from scratch by Chris. There are only two pages and no JavaScript for the base of the page.

The styling is done mobile first with a single breakpoint to keep it simple. The color palette was randomly selected from coolers.co.

See the source code on Github
